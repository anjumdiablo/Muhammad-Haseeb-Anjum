# 👋 Hey there, I’m **Muhammad Haseeb Anjum**!

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub!  

I'm a **data enthusiast** with a background in **Chemical Engineering** who somehow found his way into the fascinating world of **Data Science, Analytics, and Machine Learning**. After working as a **Chemical Operation Engineer and Project Engineer**, I realized my passion lies in **solving problems with data**, uncovering trends, and telling compelling stories through numbers.  

Recently, I completed the **General Assembly Data Science Bootcamp**, and now I’m diving deep into **data analytics, business intelligence, and machine learning**. My goal? To transition into a full-time role as a **Data Analyst, Business Analyst, or Data Engineer** where I can turn raw data into meaningful insights.  

By day, I work as a **Pharmacy Technician at Walgreens**, where I get an inside look at healthcare operations and patient data. By night (and weekends!), I’m crunching numbers, building models, and working on exciting data projects.

## 🚀 **What I Love Doing**
💡 **Finding insights in data** – There’s something satisfying about making sense of messy datasets.  
📊 **Creating visual stories** – If a graph can tell a story, I’ll make sure it does.  
🛠 **Building models that actually work** – Predicting, forecasting, and making data-driven decisions.  
🔍 **Automating boring stuff** – Who doesn’t love a good Python script to make life easier?  
🌍 **Exploring trends** – Whether it’s finance, healthcare, or Reddit discussions, I love diving into public data.

## 📚 **A Bit About My Journey**
I started my career as a **Chemical Operation Engineer**, working on large-scale industrial projects. After a few years, I moved to **Dubai** as a **Project Engineer**, where I handled data-heavy projects in operations and process optimization.  

But somewhere along the way, I realized that I was **obsessed with data**—finding patterns, optimizing systems, and improving efficiency. So, I took the leap, completed an intensive **Data Science Bootcamp**, and started building real-world projects.  

Now, I’m on a mission to break into the **Data Science & Analytics** field and apply my skills to **solve real business problems**.
